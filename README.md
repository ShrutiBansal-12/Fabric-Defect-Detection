# Fabric-Defect-Detection

In recent years, the textile industry has advanced significantly in automation, particularly in defect detection during manufacturing. This study explores the use of deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs and EfficientNetB3, for identifying textile defects. 
The model is trained on a dataset comprising both original images and texture-based features like GLCM to enhance classification accuracy. 
Achieving 92% accuracy, the system's performance is further evaluated using ROC curves and AUC scores. 
The integration of Explainable AI through Grad-CAM increases the model's reliability and interpretability.
